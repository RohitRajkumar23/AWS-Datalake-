Security and Resiliency Principles 
-----------------------------------

Overarching Principles 

1. Simplicity
Ensure the architecture is straightforward to design and comprehend. This reduces potential errors, simplifies maintenance, and facilitates easier updates and modifications.

2. Explainability
Design in a manner that is accessible and understandable, even to those without technical expertise. This involves using clear terminology and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

3. Transparency
Maintain openness in the design and operational mechanisms of the architecture. This includes knowing even all the minor components that contribute to your architecture. 

4. Relatability
Ensure the client's team can efficiently operate and manage the architecture. This requires aligning the design with the teamâ€™s skills, experiences, and operational capabilities.

5. Commercially Viable
Acknowledge and design within the constraints of the client's budget and operational expense capacity. This involves choosing cost-effective technologies and approaches that meet the project's requirements without exceeding financial limits.

6. Clarity
Provide clear, factual reasons for design choices. This involves justifying decisions with evidence, case studies, or logical reasoning to support the chosen direction.
